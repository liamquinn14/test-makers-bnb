Questions:
- Is there a limit to the requests a user can send? What if the same user tries to book more than one space for the same dates? 
- Is there a limit to the requests a user can receive? What if multiple users ask for the same place and same dates? Is that possible? Will a listing still appear to other users who looking to book a space if a 100 request has been made but, the Space owner hasn't confirmed or denied any of them yet?
