- User can click on 'about' link to go to About page, and 'login' link to go to Login page
- User can see logo, title, description and 'Sign up to MakersBnB' text as per wireframe
- Input fields are selectable, with the user able to input email, password and password confirmation. The input boxes are of the correct keyboard type (e.g. password being hidden while typed). Emails are validated the ensure they are the correct format. Password has restrictions to ensure that it is strong. Password confirmation correctly checks that the two passwords match.

- The page is responsive to different screen sizes
