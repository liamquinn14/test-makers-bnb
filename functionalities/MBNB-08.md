# MBNB-08: If a request is confirmed or denied, the 'requests' page is automatically updated 
- The user can see the state under 'Requests I've made' updated to 'confirmed' when the Space owner has clicked on the 'Confirm Request from user@me.com' on the page of that space.
- The Space owner can see the state under 'Requests I've received' updated to 'confirmed' when they click on the 'Confirm Request from example_user@me.com' on the page of that space. Other requests for that Space on that night or nights are automatically denied.
- The user can see the state under 'Requests I've made' updated to 'denied' when the Space owner has clicked on the 'Deny Request from user@me.com' on the page of that space.
- The Space owner can see the state under 'Requests I've received' updated to 'denied' when they click on the 'Deny Request from example_user@me.com'  on the page of that space. Other requests for that Space on that night(s) continue existing as 'not confirmed'
Assumptions:
- When a booking is confirmed for certain nights, that listing no longer appears on the 'Book a Space' page for said nights.
- A listing will still appear to other users who are looking to book a space if a request has been made but, the Space owner hasn't confirmed the booking yet.
Questions:
- How long can it take for a Space owner to confirm or deny the booking? Surely, there must be a limit. What if the Space owner takes months to reply? That would get in the way of user who is planning their holidays etc. Plus, it would frustrate users and they'd give up and use other sites to book.
- Can a user make several requests for specific dates? Could they for example request to book more than one spaces for the same dates? What if both Space owners of said Spaces confirmed the booking?
