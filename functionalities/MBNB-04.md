# MBNB-04: User can list a space, providing a name, description, price and available dates
- User can see a 'Lists a Space' title at the top of the page
- User can see a name, description and a price per night field, as well as two fields for dates input, one available from and one availbale to. User can input details into these fields.
- User can list a space after filling all the fileds.
- User can see a 'List my space' button at the bottom of the page.
- User can click on the 'List my space' button in order to list their space
- User will be redirected to the 'Book a space' page after clicking the 'List my space' button
- User can see a 'Spaces' button at the top right of the page and can click on it.

- User will be redirected to the 'Requests' page after clicking the 'Requests' button.
- User can see a 'Sign out' button at the top right of the page and can click on it.
Assumptions:
- User will see a '*required' message into the fields, so that he knows that he must fill all the fields.
- User will get an error if he hasn't provided input for one or more of the fields. The error message will prompt him to fill all fields in order for the space to be listed.
- User sees a message confirming the listing, after clicking the 'List my space' button and provided the listing has been successful.
- User will be redirected to the 'Sign in' page after clicking the 'Sign out' button
Questions:
- Why is the user redirected to the 'Book a space' page after clicking the 'List my space' button. Can they see their space listed (provided the available dates match)? Surely they wouldn't book their own space so I find this a bit confusing. It would make more sense if they were redirected to a page showing all their listings.
- Is there a limit to the listings a user can make? How many listings is a user able to list? As many as they want?
- Are users able to switch the currency? Is the currency automatically assigned to them when they choose country of residency?
- Is there a minimum character for the 'name' and 'description' fields?
- Do the 'name' and 'description' fields take all kinds of characters? What about special characters? What if someone input something like "$$$" or "@@@@"?
- Does the site offer recommendations to users to help them think of names and descriptions to make the listing more appealing?
